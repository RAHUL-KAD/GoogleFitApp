# Google Fit App using **Streamlit**

**This repo contains the project which predicts how much calories you burn.**

## 1. Problem Statement: 
A few months back I started using **Google Fit app.** This App counts your daily walking distnce-steps, running distance-steps, cycling distance-steps.
Your **Heart points**, **calories** and many more things. So I downloded my google fit dataset from **takeout.google.com** website.

I wanted to predict how much **calories** we will burn if we give a walking, running and cycling distance.
I used **Artificial Neural Network** to train my model.

## 2. Model Trainning:
To train my model I downloded additional dataset from kaggle. After that I dropped unncessary columns. 
Using **Simple Imputer** module from scikit-learn library I handeled missing values, after that I had to use **Stander Scaler** to scale column values.

Parameters:
  a. Number of Units = 60
  b. Activation = Rectified Linear Unit(Relu)
